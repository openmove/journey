 * Once state.user.loggedInUser is available:
 * - For new users, route them to the account page (it will show account setup).
 *   while trying to preserve the search portion of the URL before login.
 * - For existing users, simply take them to the route (itinerary search, stop/trip viewer) that was in place before login.

 * Rerouting is performed so that the current URL does not appear in the browser history.
